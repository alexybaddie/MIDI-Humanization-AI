# MIDI-Humanization-AI
AI to humanize MIDI velocities and note length

It doesn't currently do anything with the note velocities and note lengths, but I'm trying to get it to work.

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/alexybaddie/MIDI-Humanization-AI.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd MIDI-Humanization-AI
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install tensorflow numpy mido
```

Start the humanization process

```bash
  py humanize.py
```
